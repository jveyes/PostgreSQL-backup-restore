## Features

![Usage Example](img/1%20-%20MENU.png)

1. **Check PostgreSQL**: This option installs the necessary PostgreSQL client tools (based on the detected Linux distribution) and displays the versions of `psql` and `pg_dump`.

![Usage Example](img/3%20-%20OPC%201%20-%20CHECKS%20FOR%20POSTGRES%20INSTALLS.png)

2. **Backup DB**: This option prompts the user to enter the connection details for the PostgreSQL database they want to back up. It then creates a backup SQL file in the same directory as the script, using the current timestamp in the file name.

![Usage Example](img/4%20-%20OPC%202%20-%20OLD%20SERVER%20TO%20BACKUP.png)

3. **Restore DB**: This option prompts the user to enter the connection details for the PostgreSQL database they want to restore. It then lists the 2 most recent backup SQL files in the same directory as the script, and allows the user to select the file to restore.
